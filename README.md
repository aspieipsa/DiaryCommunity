You also need to have react-create-app installed in your system for this project to work (most likely). 

## Run
`yarn start`

See package.json for other scripts

## VSCode stuff
Install these packages to make life easier:
- Babel ES6/ES7

There are ready-made configs for vscode in the project, so nothing needs to be configured separately.
