/* routes for manipulating entries */

/* 

/api/entry GET - get an entry by params

/api/entry POST - add a new entry

/api/entry PUT - update existing entry

/api/entry DELETE - delete existing entry


maybe: 

/api/entry/list GET - get entry list by params (not sure if this general purpose endpoint will be convenient)
